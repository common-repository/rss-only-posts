Join the secret RSS club (https://kevq.uk/rss-club/)! Engage with your most loyal readers by delivering them unique content that's only available in the feed via the RSS/Atom feed.

== Features ==
- De-activation: If you de-activate the plugin all posts marked as "RSS Only Post" will be marked as "Draft" again, so they won't appear anywhere publicly anymore. If you re-activate the plugin the posts will be marked as "RSS post only" again.

- Uninstall: If you uninstall the plugin all information about "RSS only posts" is removed from your WordPress installation.

== Important notice ==
DO NOT simply delete the plugi via FTP or SSH, since the RSS only posts would appear on the regular blog page. Always use deactivate/uninstall!
