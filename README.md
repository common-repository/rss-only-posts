# RSS Only Posts for WordPress

## Description
Join the secret RSS club (https://kevq.uk/rss-club/)! Engage with your most loyal readers by delivering them unique content that's only available in the feed via the RSS feed.

With this plugin you can mark a blog post to appear in the feeds only. It won\'t appear on the main blog page, the archives or in the search results. 

## Requirements
* Working NPM installation.

## Installation
This plugin contains a widget for the "new" Gutenberg Block Editor. So it's necessary to install a ton of npm modules and compile the JavaScript file because it uses React:

* npm install
* npm run build

Now copy the files to the plugin directory and activate it.

## Usage
 In your "Add new post" page there will be a new Wiget on the right side called "Rss only post". Here you can define if th
 post will appear in the feed only or in the feed and all other posts pages (archive, search results, ...).
